Description: The riskCalc package provides a risk calculation system that
    is able to (1) compute Monte Carlo, historical, and parametric VaR for a
    portfolio of stock and option positions; (2) both calibrate to historical
    data and take parameters as input; (3) backtest the VaR against historical
    data.
